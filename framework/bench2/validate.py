"""Machine gates for a contributed family — the same checks CI runs.

Gates (see docs/DESIGN_SPEC.md):
  1. family.json present, required keys, valid base_plane
  2. part.py exposes build(); spec.py exposes PARAM_SPEC + check(); every
     build() parameter is declared in PARAM_SPEC
  3. per difficulty x N seeds: the framework sampler draws params that pass
     check(); the DERIVED stand-alone program (derive.py) binds `result` and
     executes to a non-degenerate solid
  4. determinism: same seed => byte-identical derived program
  5. difficulty separation: the three difficulties aren't all identical
  6. geometry-hash duplicate report within the sampled batch
  7. assembly (multi-body) families: every body is a valid solid of positive
     volume, and no two bodies interpenetrate (assembly.py)
