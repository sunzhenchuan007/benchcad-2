"""Load a family's two source files as modules.

A family is `designs/<name>/` with:
  - part.py    the parametric part      -> `build(<named params>)`
  - spec.py    the benchmark generator  -> PARAM_SPEC, check, optional refine
  - family.json  metadata

Reusable standards (keyway tables, curve math) live in `bench2.geomlib`, so
part.py never needs spec.py. When a part-specific helper is shared between
build() and a constraint (a hole layout used by both build and check), it lives
in part.py and spec.py reads it with `from part import <helper>` — spec depends
on the part, never the reverse. The loader makes that import resolve.
